# part 1
# task:  L = [0, [], [1,2,3,4], [[5],[6,7]], [8,9,10]]
# using both, indexing and slicing on L, assemble and print a new list N that contains:
# [0,2,3,[5,6],8,10] 
# as an example, here's  how i've constructed a similar list X which contains [[2, 3], [10]] from L:
#
# L = [0, [], [1,2,3,4], [[5],[6,7]], [8,9,10]]
# X = [ L[2][1:-1], L[-1][2] ] 
# print(x)  => [[2, 3], [10]]
# You need to do something similar but end up with [0,2,3,[5,6],8,10] instead. One way to work 
# through this is to break the process down in small steps, store result of each step in a new variable
# and use those variables in the next step
print("start of part 1") # set breakpoint here
L = [0, [], [1,2,3,4], [[5],[6,7]], [8,9,10]]
print(L)
# your code


print("end of 1") # set breakpoint here
